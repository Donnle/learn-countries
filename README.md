# Learn Countries

Hello, it is my fullstack MERN application. It will help you learn Countries with Leitner method.

### Leitner system

The Leitner system is a widely used method of efficiently using flashcards that was proposed by the German science
journalist Sebastian Leitner in the 1970s. It is a simple implementation of the principle of spaced repetition, where
cards are reviewed at increasing intervals.

### How to start app

If you want to run app you need to in the `learn-countries` directory and write `npm install` and `npm test` in the
console (don't close the console). Go to `learn-countries/simple_server` directory and also write `npm install` in the
console. After you need go to `learn-countries` and write `npm start` in the console. Finished! You can write
http://localhost:3000 in your browser and start learn countries!

## P. S.

If you don't need learn countries, but you like this method. You will change DataBase and learn what you want. In
file `db.json` you will see database fields.


UPD: 
I hope you will not crash my database =)
